# Social Meta
[social-meta.php](social-meta.php) is a self-contained library for a WordPress theme that generates [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/opengraph)-appropriate [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) tags and [Twitter Card](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview) tags appropriate for a personal site. 

I wrote this because there are what seems like a hundred different WordPress Open Graph/Facebook/social/sharing plugins, but none of which did exactly what I wanted. They either had features locked behind paywall, or acted as nagware, or were simply outdated.

## Usage
Social Meta requires my separate [Article Images](https://github.com/bhalash/article-images) library, to extract the correct image and its dimensions. Once you have that loaded (Social Meta will do this itself), you need to include the file in your `functions.php` file:

    $my_social_meta_instance = new Social_Meta(array(
        'twitter' => '@bhalash'
        'facebook' => 'bhalash'
        'fallback_image = array(
            'url' => 'http://url/to/image.jpg',
            'path' => '/filesystem/path/to/image.jpg
        )
    ));

That's it! 

## Support
Your mileage will vary; while this library is suitable for my site, it's compatibility with yours is unknowable. Caveat emptor! Pull requests and forks are welcome. If you have a simple support question, email <mark@bhalash.com>.
