# Social Meta
social-meta is a self-contained library for WordPress that generates [Twitter Card][1] [Open Graph][2] header meta tag information.

## Usage
To initialize:

    include('/path/to/social-meta/social-meta.php');

    $my_social_meta_instance = new Social_Meta([
        'twitter' => '@username',
        'facebook' => 'username',
        'fallback_image' => [
            'url' => get_template_directory_uri() . '/path/to/image.jpg',
            'path' => get_template_directory() . '/path/to/image.jpg'
        ]
    ]);

That's it!
